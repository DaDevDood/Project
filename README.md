# Project
A project I have been working on for a past couple of days to learn shader graphs and mess around with water stuff. 
Probably turn this into a ocean-based game insipred from Subnautica and Outer Wilds. Let's see how this abomination turns out.

UPDATE: This project is discontinued because I lost motivation and I also have exams lmao.
